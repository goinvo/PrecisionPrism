<h1>Envision all of a human's health</h1>

<p>The Precision Prism will envision health views by utilizing all human data elements mapped to the social determinants of health. The clinical, biological and genetic, societal, environmental, and the cultural. By leveraging the Precision Medicine Initiative data elements, we will design baseline precision patient and clinician health views.</p>

<p>A guideline for how providers and patients will see, interact, and use a precision health view does not exist. Thatâ€™s where Precision Prism comes in.</p>

<p>Precision Prism will provide the nation with an open source, baseline design for viewing and interacting with precision medicine information in order to deliver it to the hands of patients, clinicians, and care teams to make faster, better, decisions.</p>
