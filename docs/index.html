<h1>Envision all of a human's health</h1>

<p>The Precision Prism will envision health views by utilizing all human data elements mapped to the social determinants of health. The clinical, biological and genetic, societal, environmental, and the cultural. By leveraging the Precision Medicine Initiative data elements, we will design baseline precision patient and clinician health views.</p>

<p>A guideline for how providers and patients will see, interact, and use a precision health view does not exist. Thatâ€™s where Precision Prism comes in.</p>

<p>Precision Prism will provide the nation with an open source, baseline design for viewing and interacting with precision medicine information in order to deliver it to the hands of patients, clinicians, and care teams to make faster, better, decisions.</p>

<p>We are a part of a global movement to shift the healthcare system to one of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Every person having a standard health record that they own</li>
	<li>Precision medicine, in which personal data drives health decisions evolving services</li>
	<li>Simple, non-invasive personal diagnostics</li>
	<li>Seamless machine- and clinician-driven services that work for patients and their families</li>
	<li>Access to healthcare services anywhere with an internet connection</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting there is equal parts smart technology, healthcare reform, and literacy. We're here to help with designing the future of healthcare while evangelizing for the entire system to evolve to better serve patients. It all starts with sharing a vision.</p>
