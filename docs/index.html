		<p>The amount of data Precision Medicine will bring is exciting but vast. We're designing ahead of the data firehose for when people have access, people can make sense of it, take action, and prosper.</p>

		<p>We'll see and present data across all the determinants of health:</p>

	<p><strong>A health record tailored to you.</strong><br />
	For the first time, a single health record will accommodate you – whether you're a clinician, patient, or the care team. From pediatric to geriatric, to everywhere in between, a health record will finally evolve with all of life's moments.</p>

	<p><strong>Sharing is caring.</strong><br />
	Craft your care team and keep them informed so they can better help you. Or maybe you're looking to help a loved one or even researchers with the next moonshot. Whichever the cause, go for it!</p>
